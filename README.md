Project Title: Guess Who – "Mais c'est qui ce bouffon ?"

------------------------------------------------------------

Overview  
This project is a simple, playful web implementation of a "Guess Who" style game. The interface displays a grid of checkboxes representing characters, along with interactive buttons that allow you to save the current board state, load a state from the clipboard, or load one by entering data manually. The design is styled via an external CSS file, and the interactivity is handled by a JavaScript script.

Features  
• Interactive grid: The game board is a table of checkboxes (24 in total) representing different characters.  
• Board state management: Easily save your current board configuration using the “Sauvegarder” button.  
• Multiple loading options: Restore a board state from the clipboard or by manually entering the data via the provided buttons.  
• Responsive design: The HTML meta information hints at a mobile-friendly version for on‑the‑go play.
